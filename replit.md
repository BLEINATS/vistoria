# Vistoria - Property Inspection App

## Overview
A React/TypeScript application for property inspections with Supabase backend integration. The app allows users to manage properties, conduct entry/exit inspections, upload photos, and generate reports.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 + TypeScript + Vite 6.3.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF + html2canvas
- **Icons**: Lucide React

- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured (.env file with Supabase keys)
- ‚úÖ Development workflow set up (npm run dev)
- ‚úÖ Application running successfully
- ‚úÖ Deployment configuration set up (autoscale with build/serve)
- ‚úÖ Host blocking issue resolved

  - Implemented robust data loading that always shows user email and name when available
  - **Fixed RLS policy issues**: Resolved Row Level Security and schema cache errors by simplifying database operations
  - **Fixed profile fields mismatch**: Corrected code to use only existing table fields (full_name, avatar_url) instead of non-existent fields (phone, company)
  - **Fixed comparison summary logic**: Corrected bug where items with condition "not_found" were incorrectly paired instead of being counted as missing items
  - **Fixed Dashboard critical issues calculation**: Enhanced logic to properly detect critical issues from not_found and damaged items
  - **Removed Dashboard charts**: Removed inspection trends and issues distribution charts as requested
  - **Changed dashboard card**: Changed "Problemas Cr√≠ticos" to "Itens Faltando da √öltima Vistoria" and updated logic to count only items with condition "not_found" from the most recent completed inspection
  - **Fixed dashboard data accuracy**: Modified logic to fetch data specifically from the latest inspection instead of all inspections
  - **Verified action links functionality**: Confirmed that "Nova Vistoria" and "Relat√≥rios" quick action links are working correctly
  - **Removed visual markers**: Removed red object detection markers from photos in all components (AnalysisResult, Reports, ComparisonItem) for cleaner interface
  - **Fixed comparative report image display**: Fixed bug where missing items showed entry photo for both entry and exit - now correctly shows entry photo and actual exit photo for proper comparison
  - **Fixed new items photo display**: Enhanced "Itens Novos na Sa√≠da" to show entry photo for context instead of "Sem foto" - now shows before/after comparison
  - **Removed visual markers from comparative reports**: Removed red pins due to positioning issues - interface now focuses on clear text-based comparison without visual markers
  - **Fixed dashboard missing items count**: Corrected logic to count items from latest EXIT inspection only (not entry) to match comparative report numbers
  - **Fixed field naming**: Corrected Dashboard to use 'inspection_type' instead of 'type' field to match database schema
  - **Synchronized counting logic**: Updated Dashboard to use identical logic as comparative report for counting missing items, ensuring exact number matching between dashboard and reports
  - **Fixed mobile scrolling issue**: Corrected GlowCard animation component to allow normal page scrolling on mobile devices while preserving desktop hover effects
  - **Enhanced quick actions intelligence**: Updated Dashboard quick actions to redirect smartly - "Nova Vistoria" goes to latest property/inspection, "Relat√≥rios" goes to latest comparative report
  - **Renamed quick action**: Changed "Nova Vistoria" to "√öltima Vistoria" and updated to redirect to Property Management page of latest property
  - **Renamed quick action**: Changed "Relat√≥rios" to "√öltimo Relat√≥rios" - continues directing to latest comparative report
  - **Fixed "√öltimo Relat√≥rios" redirection**: Corrected Dashboard query to include inspections data and fixed logic to properly detect properties with completed entry and exit inspections, ensuring the quick action redirects to the correct comparative report
  - **ü§ñ MAJOR AI CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENTS**: Implemented comprehensive solution for AI analysis inconsistencies
    - **Duplicate image detection**: Added smart detection for when same image is used in entry/exit
    - **Conservative analysis mode**: For duplicate images, system now copies entry analysis instead of re-analyzing
    - **Enhanced prompts**: Added specific instructions for consistent AI analysis with conservative comparison mode
    - **Image seed generation**: Implemented deterministic seed based on image URL for reproducible results
    - **Intelligent fallbacks**: System prioritizes consistency over fresh analysis when images are identical
  - **üéØ ENHANCED OBJECT DETECTION ACCURACY**: Dramatically improved AI object detection for property inspections
    - **Room-specific object lists**: Added detailed lists of priority objects for each environment type (living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, etc.)
    - **Assertive detection instructions**: Enhanced prompts to focus on 70% inspection core: "what's there and what's missing"
    - **Inventory-focused analysis**: Prioritized tangible, countable objects over construction finishes
    - **Detailed object specifications**: Enhanced detection to include material, color, and condition details
    - **Priority hierarchies**: Structured object detection by importance (furniture > appliances > accessories > installations)
    - **üîÑ STANDARDIZED ANALYSIS CRITERIA**: Fixed inconsistencies between entry and exit inspections
      - **Unified nomenclature**: Both entry and exit now use identical object naming conventions
      - **Consistent materials**: Standardized material detection (tecido, madeira, metal, vidro, cer√¢mica, couro, pl√°stico)
      - **Consistent colors**: Standardized color palette (branco, preto, cinza, marrom, bege, azul, verde, vermelho, amarelo)
      - **Same detection logic**: Both analyses use identical criteria to prevent false differences
      - **Reference-based comparison**: Exit analysis now references entry inventory for consistency
- ‚úÖ **üñ•Ô∏è IMPROVED DESKTOP RESPONSIVENESS**: Enhanced desktop design while maintaining mobile compatibility
  - **Full-screen layout**: Added structured full-screen background with proper container widths
